Conic Planet 1.2
July 17, 2000

A lot of the code of this package is from the amazing XPlanet
program written by Hari Nair <hari@alumni.caltech.edu>.
So a lot of credit for this work goes to him.

// Snip from XPlanet's CREDITS ---

Most of the algorithms are taken from "Astronomical Formulae for
Calculators" by Jean Meeus, published by Willman-Bell.  The rotational
parameters for the other terrestrial planets are taken from "Practical
Ephemeris Calculations" by Oliver Montenbruck, published by
Springer-Verlag.  Rotational parameters for the Moon are taken from
Davies et al. (1996), Celestial Mechanics 63, 127--148.

Thanks to ... 

James Baughman for the HP-UX patches and help with the autoconf macros.

Erik Bruhwiler of the Living Planet, Inc., for graciously supplying
the maps for my web page.

Matthew Francey for help with the projections.

Kirk Johnson for writing Xearth in the first place.  

Jeremie Petit for some Digital Unix help.

Henri Simoes for the french translation of the man page.

Per Erik Stendahl and Larry Reeder for catching a bug in
process_args().  Hopefully I won't be seeing too many more mysterious
segfaults. 

John Tillema for finding a bug where markers weren't positioned
properly if --center was specified.

Detlev Zundel for the debian packages, man pages, and the orbit option.
