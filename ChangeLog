ChangeLog for Conic Planet:

17 July 2000

	Version 1.2
	Added code for enhancment of contrast of the SSEC cloud image
	and smoothening of seam at 180 deg. longitude line in the
	SSEC cloud image. Added brightness and gamma-correction
	controls. Added support for greyscale (R=G=B) output.

5 July 2000

	Version 1.1.1f
	Bug fix for a large error in scaling code.

5 July 2000

	Version 1.1.1
	Cloud handling code modified to include a threshold
	level for what clouds are shown. The option "smoothen"
	was added for generating image at a higher resolution and
	using a bilinear filter to resize it, so that aliasing artifacts
	are smoothened out. PNG support was added for output content-type.
	The output content-type is now set using the "contenttype" option.
	Some other minor tweaks.

27 June 2000

	Version 1.1.0
	Support for more planets, moons n' stuff. Another option
	"terminator" added. Clouds support added using the
	cloud information available at the Space Science and
	Engineering Center (SSEC) at the University of Wisconsin.
	Many thanks again to Hari Nair (I swear I tried it myself,
	but that border killed my mollweide->rectangular
	transformation). Added aclocal.m4 for detecting libjpeg.
	A PHP form (test.php) is included to view the program's various
	features. This can be used with a PHP-enabled webserver.

14 June 2000

	Version 1.0.0
	Initial public code-release
