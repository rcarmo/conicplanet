Conic Planet 1.2
July 17, 2000

The usual sequence of "./configure; make" should build the program.
Conic Planet needs the Independent JPEG Group's libjpeg library and
the PNG library to compile. libjpeg is used to read the map files and
also write the output image/jpeg content. The PNG library is used
to read the cloud information.

OS dependent things:
On Digital Unix, with the native C++ compiler, compile with the option
-ieee_with_no_inexact.  

You need maps to use this program. For pointers to good maps,
visit the XPlanet homepage. http://xplanet.sourceforge.net/

To check a running version of this program, visit
http://conic.sourceforge.net/conicplanet/

You may have to provide CGI key/value pairs with various
arguments as required. Acceptable key/value pairs can be
found in README.

Conic Planet looks in the directory specified in auxfiles.h
for the mapfiles. Files should be named body.jpg,
where body can be mercury, venus, earth, moon, or mars.

A list of maps i use are:

earth.jpg                // regular day maps
mercury.jpg
venus.jpg
moon.jpg
mars.jpg

earth-highres.jpg        // high resolution

earth-night.jpg          // earth's night map
